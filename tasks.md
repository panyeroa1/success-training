Current behavior or state:
- Captions are large, bold, and use emerald speaker stickers.
- Captions use the default call language.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Refine `TranscriptionOverlay` to use thinner (font-light) and smaller text.
- Change rendering to a classic subtitle style (text-shadow instead of background boxes).
- Update `MeetingRoom` to use `language: 'auto'` for auto-detection and original language.

Files or modules expected to change:
- components/meeting-room.tsx
- components/transcription-overlay.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- Readability of smaller text on complex backgrounds.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [x] Refine CSS in `TranscriptionOverlay`
- [x] Enable auto-detection in `MeetingRoom`
- [x] Verify build

Timestamp: 2026-01-01 07:55
Current behavior or state:
- Transcriptions are saved in Supabase, but no automatic translation is performed.

Plan and scope for this task:
- Create a translation API using Gemini (models/gemini-flash-lite-latest).
- Implement saving translated text to the Supabase translations table.
- Add a language selector to the MeetingRoom UI.
- Trigger translation automatically when new transcription segments are finalized.
- Display translated captions in the TranscriptionOverlay.

Files or modules expected to change:
- app/api/translate/route.ts
- lib/translate-service.ts
- components/meeting-room.tsx
- components/transcription-overlay.tsx

Risks or things to watch out for:
- API latency during real-time meetings.
- Gemini API quota/limits.

WORK CHECKLIST

- [ ] Implement Gemini translation API
- [ ] Create Supabase translation storage service
- [ ] Add language selector to Meeting Room UI
- [ ] Integrate translation trigger in Overlay
- [ ] Verify build and functionality
